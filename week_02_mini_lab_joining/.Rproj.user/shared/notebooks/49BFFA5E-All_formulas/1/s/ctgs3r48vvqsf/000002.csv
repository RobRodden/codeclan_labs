# Here's a description of what each line of the code is doing:

top_row <- formula_tibble[5, ] %>% select(1:64) # This line extracts the 5th row of formula_tibble and selects the first 64 columns. It creates a new tibble named top_row containing these selected columns.
formula_tibble2 <- formula_tibble %>% select(65:128) # This line selects columns 65 to 128 from the original formula_tibble and creates a new tibble named formula_tibble2 containing only these columns.
header <- colnames(top_row) # This line stores the column names of the top_row tibble in a variable named header.
colnames(top_row) <- top_row # This line assigns the values of the top_row tibble (which are likely column names) as the column names of the top_row tibble itself.
top_row <- clean_names(top_row) # This line uses the clean_names function to convert the column names in top_row to clean, lowercase and underscore-separated names.
colnames(formula_tibble2) <- top_row # This line assigns the cleaned column names from the top_row tibble to the formula_tibble2 tibble.
formula_tibble2 <- clean_names(formula_tibble2) # This line uses the clean_names function to convert the column names in formula_tibble2 to clean, lowercase and underscore-separated names.
print(formula_tibble2) # This line prints the final formula_tibble2 tibble with the cleaned column names.

#Overall, this code is reshaping the formula_tibble and top_row tibbles to have the same column names and clean those column names using the clean_names function. The formula_tibble2 tibble is then printed with the cleaned column names.
